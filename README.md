# Epimetheus
*The open source Pandora Music app for Android.*



Epimetheus is an open-source Pandora Music client for Android. The app uses [libepimetheus](https://github.com/EpimetheusAndroid/libepimetheus) to connect to Pandora. Both the app and the library are currently in development, and pull requests and issues are welcome.

## This version of the app is abandoned. I'm rewriting it with Flutter.

#### Implemented features

- View stations
- Play stations
- Feedback
- Android wear integration
- Android auto integration (not tested; but should work)
- [Portaller](http://portaller.com/) support, to access Pandora outside the US.

#### To-do

- Browse UI
- View song details
- Manage stations (create, delete, add music, etc.)
- Manage audio focus
- Build a settings page (audio format, art resolution, portaller, etc.)
- Register screen
